I optimized my face for my dating profile. Watch out ladies.

Setup
---------

First I had to decide on my search dimensions. I settled on:

* With / Without glasses
* Facing forward / side
* Smiling / Not smiling
* Facial hair style (full beard, shaved neck, shaven)

This ends up being 24 combinations. [Todd](http://toddmedema.com) was kind enough to help me set up a photo-taking station complete with umbrella lighting and a DSLR. He realized this was going to take awhile, handed me a remote shutter controller, and left me to take my photos.

Testing
-------

About 90 minutes and 24 photos later I had all my pictures. I had originally thought I'd need to create my own survey and use something like Amazon's [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com) but then I found [PhotoFeeler](https://www.photofeeler.com/), a website dedicated to this kind of thing.

For each photo I gathered 40 votes from females up to age 37 along three dimensions - intelligence, trustworthiness, and attractiveness.

Results
-------

After $157 spent and I had the 24 x 40 = 960 votes in, I decided to do some aggregations. This means I averaged across all the images for say, glasses vs no glasses.

Turns out, people with glasses look more intelligent! Who knew?

What about where I was looking?

This one was totally surprising to me because it contradicts [OKCupid's data](https://theblog.okcupid.com/the-4-big-myths-of-profile-pictures-41bedf26e4d) on the same subject. At least for me, it doesn't appear to make much of a difference. In the one case it did, attractiveness, looking to the side had a negative impact, something OKCupid suggests will have a positive effect.

Next up: smiling

Ah! Another contradiction of OKCupid data. Smiling was the tested factor with the largest impact by far.

Lastly, facial hair.

There have been [a](http://file.scirp.org/Html/2-6901043_44185.htm) [few](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/1990/00000018/00000001/art00019) [studies](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13527260903157383) regarding beardedness and perceived trustworthiness and attractiveness, but I expected getting rid of my neckbeard to help, not hurt. Maybe I'll be a true Software Engineer and keep it.

Potential Confounding Factors
-----------------------------

When taking photos for 90 minutes and smiling about half the time, my face muscles definitely got tired. Despite my best efforts, I suspect my smile was a bit less genuine and attractive as time went on. My facial hair was the factor that changed the fewest times, so it's a good proxy for time. This could explain the decline in attractiveness with reducing facial hair.

Fin.
